This is a simple Java project demonstrating the use of Git and GitHub workflows while developing a small program with basic sorting functionality. The project includes two main features:
1. Sorting an array of integers
2. Sorting an array of strings

Each feature was developed on its own Git branch, following a structured Git workflow that includes branching, committing, merging, and resolving conflicts.

Features
1. Integer Sorting: A method to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
2. String Sorting: A method to sort an array of strings alphabetically.

Each feature has been tested using JUnit to verify correct functionality.
